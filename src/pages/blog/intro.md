Both [gatsby](https://gatsbyjs.org) and [grommet](https://grommet.io) recently released their V2 and I've been playing around with both of them both contributing
by fixing issues, releasing plugins and spreading the word.

Since gatsby been experimenting with themes recently i thought of creating one that
combines both gatsby and grommet!
